Abstract
Natural and man-made disasters pose a growing threat to cities, which are our constructed assets. To improve urban resilience and protect the populations they serve, it is essential to plan for, endure recover from, and adapt to these disruptions. In order to address the problem, this thesis studies the ways in which urban resilience could potentially be improved using the application of asset and risk management concepts.
Enhancing urban resilience through structured asset and risk management methods is the main goal of this study. The objective is to reduce disaster hazards on urban critical constructed infrastructure by developing a Risk-Informed Asset-Centric (RIACT) framework and applying novel tools and methods. In order to further build resilience, the research also intends to show how applicable and successful urban resilience enhancement strategies are, incorporating climate adaption measures into the RIACT framework.
The methodologies developed include the RIACT decision-making process, combining risk and asset management tools, the Geospatial Urban Resilience Evaluation System (G-URES) for location-specific assessments, the GeoAI model for disaster risk evaluation, and the Urban Resilience Index (URI) to quantify resilience. These methods are used in case studies that address a variety of disaster risks, such as the exposure of road networks to floods, flood risk identification using GeoAI models, and earthquake risk assessments at the municipal level. Furthermore, the whole resilience strategy incorporates climate adaptation measures involving ecosystems, public health, water management, and physical infrastructure.
The findings show that the suggested approaches greatly increase urban resilience and offer guidance to engineers, legislators, and city planners. To further improve the techniques' applicability across various locations and risk types, future research should concentrate on integrating a wider range of data sources, broadening the context of case studies, and investigating more catastrophe scenarios and asset types.

Resumo
As cidades, como os nossos ativos construídos, enfrentam um risco crescente de disrupções devido a desastres naturais e provocados pelo homem. É important preparar, resistir, recuperar e adaptar-se a essas disrupções para melhorar a resiliência urbana e proteger as comunidades. Esta tese aborda o desafio, explorando como os princípios de gestão de ativos e riscos podem ser aplicados para aumentar a resiliência urbana.
Os objetivos de pesquisa focam em melhorar a resiliência urbana através de estratégias estruturadas de gestão de ativos e riscos. O objetivo é desenvolver um quadro de decisão centrado em ativos e informado por riscos (RIACT), utilizando ferramentas e metodologias avançadas para mitigar riscos de desastres em infraestruturas urbanas. A pesquisa também visa demonstrar a aplicabilidade e eficácia das estratégias de aumento da resiliência urbana, integrando medidas de adaptação climática ao quadro RIACT para reforçar ainda mais a resiliência.
As metodologias desenvolvidas incluem o processo de decisão RIACT, combinando ferramentas de gestão de ativos e riscos, o Sistema de Avaliação de Resiliência Urbana Geoespacial (G-URES) para avaliações localizadas, o modelo GeoAI para avaliação de riscos de desastres e o Índice de Resiliência Urbana (URI) para quantificar a resiliência. Estes métodos são aplicados em estudos de caso abordando vários riscos de desastres, incluindo avaliações de risco de terremoto a nível municipal, identificação de riscos de inundação através de modelos GeoAI e a exposição de redes viárias a inundações. Adicionalmente, estratégias de adaptação climática relacionadas a infraestruturas físicas, ecossistemas, gestão de águas e saúde pública são integradas na abordagem de resiliência.
Os resultados demonstram que as metodologias propostas melhoram significativamente a resiliência urbana, fornecendo insights para planejadores urbanos, legisladores e engenheiros. Trabalhos futuros devem se concentrar na incorporação de fontes de dados mais diversificadas, na ampliação do contexto dos estudos de caso e na exploração de cenários adicionais de desastres e tipos de ativos para aumentar a aplicabilidade das metodologias em diferentes regiões e tipos de risco.

1	Introduction 
In this chapter, we lay the groundwork for the thesis. We begin by discussing why enhancing urban resilience against natural and man-made disasters is important. We then outline the problem statement, highlighting the key challenges and gaps our research aims to address. Next, we present the research questions that guide our investigation and focus our study. We detail our objectives, specifying the goals we aim to achieve. Finally, we provide a brief overview of the thesis structure, summarizing how the document is organized.
1.1	Motivation
Cities around the world are growing rapidly. By 2030, more than 60% of the global population is expected to live in urban areas (Acuto, Parnell and Seto, 2018). This shift brings challenges to the sustainability and resilience of our cities. Urban areas contribute over 75% of the global GDP, making them important to the world economy. However, this concentration of people and economic activities leads to high energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, since 90% of metropolitan areas are located on coasts, many people are at risk from climate change-related disasters (M. D. C. D. C. Almeida et al., 2021).
Cities face many hazards, both natural and man-made. Natural disasters like earthquakes, floods, and storms can seriously impact urban areas (Anelli, Tajani and Ranieri, 2022; Huddleston et al., 2022).  The World Bank notes that these disasters can disrupt information flow and trade, threaten security, and cause widespread destruction (The World Bank, 2010). They can displace people, damage infrastructure, and disrupt essential services.
To manage risks effectively, we need to identify potential hazards, assess vulnerabilities, and take steps to reduce impacts (The World Bank, 2010). This means creating early warning systems, enforcing building codes, and developing emergency response plans.
Supply chain interruptions are increasingly common in today's global economy. Enhancing urban resilience is a pressing challenge that requires a multidisciplinary approach involving all stakeholders (Almeida, Sousa, Alves Dias, et al., 2015; Liu, Jian and Nie, 2021; Gangwal and Dong, 2022). Strengthening urban resilience is important for the long-term sustainability and well-being of cities and their residents (Houghton and Castillo-Salgado, 2017; Heinzlef et al., 2020).
Urban resilience refers to a city's ability to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to shocks and stresses like natural disasters, economic downturns, or social disruptions (Meerow et al., 2016). This involves taking preventive measures, keeping critical services running during crises, quickly restoring functions after disasters, and adapting to new challenges (Hosseini, Barker and Ramirez-Marquez, 2016). By addressing these areas, cities can better handle uncertainties and maintain a good quality of life for their people.
Critical infrastructure, such as transportation networks, water systems, energy grids, communication networks, and healthcare facilities—is vital for society and the economy (Almaleh and Tipper, 2022; CISA, 2023). Managing these infrastructures carefully ensures they are reliable and robust. Asset management means systematically developing, operating, maintaining, and upgrading assets in a cost-effective way. For critical infrastructure, this involves regular inspections, maintenance, and upgrades to help them withstand and recover from disasters. Prioritizing investments based on risk assessments and the importance of assets is also important (M. D. C. D. C. Almeida et al., 2021). effective asset management keeps critical infrastructure functional during and after disasters, supporting overall urban resilience.
We can use novel GIS techniques and tools to generate and present the results of resilience assessments and planning (Fischer and Trometer, 2019; Rezvani et al., 2023; Villani, Giovinazzi and Costanzo, 2023). Geospatial AI combines artificial intelligence with geographic information systems to analyze spatial data. It uses machine learning to predict disaster impacts, identify vulnerable areas, and optimize emergency response plans. Advanced mapping tools help visualize resilience data in an understandable and actionable way, creating interactive maps that show risk assessments and critical infrastructure locations (Li, 2020; Li et al., 2023).
By integrating risk and asset management, we ensure that urban areas stay resilient over time (Almeida, Sousa, Dias, et al., 2015; Ríos and González, 2021). This involves conducting risk assessments to identify and prioritize risks to critical infrastructure and urban systems. It means developing strategic plans that incorporate risk and asset management principles, fostering collaboration among stakeholders, and setting up continuous improvement processes where strategies are regularly reviewed and updated based on new information and changing conditions (Arnette and Zobel, 2019; Rezvani et al., 2023).
Man-made disasters like industrial accidents, terrorism, and cyber-attacks also pose threats to urban resilience (Rose, 2007). Managing risks for these events includes strengthening security measures, conducting regular risk assessments, and encouraging collaboration between stakeholders like government agencies, private companies, and the community. By proactively managing both natural and man-made disaster risks, cities can enhance their resilience and better withstand and recover from adverse events (Frantzeskaki, Kabisch and McPhearson, 2016; Davidson et al., 2019; Wardekker et al., 2020).
Research shows that an urban resilience evaluation system can combine multiple dimensions critical for enhancing a city's ability to withstand and recover from disasters (Moores et al., 2017; Z. Li et al., 2022). These dimensions include environmental factors like vulnerability to earthquakes, tsunamis, fires, and floods; economic factors like insurance coverage and financial resilience; organizational aspects such as business continuity planning and regulatory compliance; technical elements like building safety and infrastructure robustness; and social parameters like access to emergency services, community resilience, and social vulnerability. This holistic approach helps cities prepare for and mitigate various hazards, promoting resilience and sustainability in urban environments.
However, traditional decision-making often lacks objectivity and consistency, leading to biased outcomes and poor resource allocation. Resilience assessments usually focus on specific aspects like infrastructure or social factors, ignoring the interconnected environmental, economic, organizational, social, and technical dimensions. This oversight can miss critical vulnerabilities. Conventional models for predicting natural disasters are often reactive—they respond after events occur instead of proactively anticipating and mitigating risks. This reduces the effectiveness of risk reduction efforts.
Traditional risk management often doesn't account for the complex interdependencies within urban systems, leading to ineffective planning and resource allocation. There's a pressing need for a systematic, data-driven methodology to help urban planners and decision-makers identify and analyze multifaceted disaster risks, evaluate asset systems, prioritize resilience-building initiatives, and measure success.
GIS tools can help by simulating the impacts of different disaster scenarios and evaluating the effectiveness of various resilience strategies. This aids in understanding potential outcomes and making informed decisions. Effective communication is essential for enhancing urban resilience, and GIS tools can create visualizations that make complex information easier to understand. This helps stakeholders and the public grasp the risks and measures being taken to enhance resilience.
Addressing these challenges requires advanced methods to assess vulnerable areas and infrastructure. Socio-economic factors greatly influence community vulnerability and resilience to natural hazards, so it's essential to develop equitable resilience strategies that prioritize marginalized populations (Jabeen, Johnson and Allen, 2010; Wagner, 2011; Wholey, 2015; Adeyeye and Emmitt, 2017). Advanced methodologies for disaster prediction and risk management introduce challenges in integrating various types of data, necessitating innovative solutions for analysis. Evaluating the vulnerability of critical infrastructure needs thorough methods and data integration to effectively prioritize mitigation efforts.
This research aims to advance our understanding and implementation of urban resilience strategies, helping cities better withstand and recover from disruptive events while fostering more resilient and sustainable urban environments (Prashar, Shaw and Takeuchi, 2013; Espada, Apan and McDougall, 2017a). This is significant in the field of civil engineering, where climate change, resilience, and sustainable infrastructure are critical priorities for ensuring the safety, health, and quality of life of communities worldwide. By developing innovative and cost-effective solutions to protect vulnerable populations and provide access to safe and reliable infrastructure, civil engineers play a key role in addressing these pressing challenges.
This thesis looks at new ways to solve these challenges by using different approaches. It combines risk-based decision-making with asset management to improve resilience through cost-effective solutions. By using advanced tools, it improves models and helps assess urban resilience in many areas. The goal is to guide interventions that make communities stronger and ensure decisions are based on both qualitative and quantitative data for better strategy choices.
For these methods to work, people like stakeholders, policymakers, researchers, and communities must work together. Training programs are key to giving stakeholders the skills needed to apply these new approaches. It is also important to regularly check and update strategies to adjust to changing conditions. Sharing knowledge and best practices among all involved will help improve resilience planning and disaster management over time.
1.2	Research questions
The research questions are designed to guide the research work and help build a framework that is consistent and compatible with advanced tools and methods that, in combination, can boost urban resilience.
Q1: Can urban resilience be effectively enhanced through structured risk and asset management strategies and methodologies?
Q2: Is it possible to develop a Risk-Informed Asset-CenTric (RIACT) framework and employ advanced tools and methodologies to mitigate disaster risks for constructed assets, thereby enhancing urban infrastructure resilience?
Q3: Is it possible to demonstrate that urban resilience enhancement strategies are applicable and effective?
Q4: Can climate adaptation measures be merged with the RIACT framework and enhance urban resilience?
Q1 aims to identify the most effective practices and systematically integrate them into urban planning and policy-making processes. The underlying hypothesis is that, by using structured approaches as asset management and risk management, cities and communities can better prepare for and respond to disruptive events, ensuring the safety and well-being of their inhabitants while maintaining essential services. This question also implies an exploration of the interplay between these strategies and urban sustainability and the importance of a coordinated approach among different urban stakeholders.
Building on the insights from Q1, Q2 enquires about the suitability of a Risk-Informed Asset-CenTric (RIACT) framework that integrates risk management and asset management processes. This approach is expected to allow systematical assessments and prioritizations of urban resilience enhancement measures for critical infrastructure and other types of engineering assets and asset system, leading to more robust and adaptable urban systems. The research question is also a driver for exploring ways of integrating advanced tools and methodologies, such as geospatial analysis and innovative technologies, and see if these can facilitate detailed risk assessments and informed decision-making towards enhanced urban resilience.
Q3 emphasizes the difficulties of validation of urban resilience strategies. This question is intended to guide the application of the RIACT framework and associated tools to specific urban contexts and investigate the practical applicability and effectiveness of these strategies. Potential use cases are expected to demonstrate the framework's ability to enhance urban resilience in diverse settings.
Finally, Q4 explores the integration of climate adaptation measures into the RIACT framework as a means to further enhance urban resilience. This involves identifying and clustering various adaptation measures across different domains, such as physical infrastructure, ecosystem restoration, water management, policy and planning, and health and social interventions. By strategically incorporating these measures into the resilience evaluation and decision-making processes, it is expected that cities can better address the challenges posed by evolving climate risks and other disruptive events.
Collectively, these research questions aim to contribute to the advancement of the understanding and implementation of urban resilience strategies, empowering cities to better withstand and recover from disruptive events while fostering more resilient and sustainable urban environments.
1.3	Objectives
This thesis is dedicated to enhancing urban resilience in the face of natural and man-made disasters, with a focus on developing strategies and methodologies that can fortify cities against diverse disruptive events. To achieve this, the following objectives have been established:
Objective 1: Develop structured strategies and methodologies for urban resilience
Aligned with Q1, the primary objective is to design and develop a structured approach to assess and enhance urban resilience. This involves identifying the most effective practices and systematically integrating them into urban planning and policy-making processes. By doing so, this research aims to provide cities with robust frameworks. It aims to prepare for and mitigate the impacts of various disruptive events, ensuring the safety and well-being of their inhabitants while maintaining essential services.
Objective 2: Develop and implement a Risk-Informed Asset-Centric (RIACT) framework
Based on Q1, the second objective, corresponding to Q2, is to structure a Risk-Informed Asset-Centric (RIACT) framework. This framework will use advanced tools and methodologies to mitigate disaster risks and asset exposure/impacts, enhancing the resilience of urban infrastructure. The objective is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the RIACT framework in providing practical insights and strategies for urban resilience, ensuring targeted and cost-effective and impactful resilience investments.
Objective 3: Pilot-testing through case studies
Building on Q2, the third objective, related to Q3, is to test and validate the proposed urban resilience strategies through detailed case studies. This involves applying the developed frameworks, tools, methods, and approaches to specific urban contexts to provide concrete evidence of their practical utility and effectiveness. The objective is to study applications at different levels (e.g. macro-level analysis of a municipality and micro-level analysis of asset systems and networks) and involving different types of disaster risks (e.g. earthquake and flooding) and different asset type (e.g. roads). By doing so, the research aims to showcase the potential adaptability of the RIACT framework in diverse urban environments, highlighting its strengths and identifying areas for further improvement.
Objective 4: Integrate climate adaptation measures into the RIACT framework
Aligned with Q3, the fourth objective, corresponding to Q4, explores the integration of climate adaptation measures into the RIACT framework. This involves identifying and clustering various adaptation measures across different domains (e.g. physical infrastructure, ecosystem restoration, water management, policy and planning, and health and social interventions). By strategically incorporating these measures into resilience assessment and decision-making processes, cities are expected to be better prepared for the challenges posed by evolving climate risks and other disruptive events. This question aims at pushing the research towards actionable strategies (e.g. to cope with flood events) and contribute to providing decision-makers with the knowledge and tools necessary to proactively enhance urban resilience.
These objectives, collectively, aim to advance the understanding and implementation of urban resilience strategies. By developing targeted methodologies, improving risk assessment frameworks, integrating analytical approaches, and empirically validating these strategies, this thesis seeks to provide insights and practical solutions for enhancing urban resilience. The ultimate goal is to empower cities to better withstand and recover from disruptive events, fostering more resilient and sustainable urban environments.
1.4	Thesis structure 
This thesis structure hereby presented will help the reader to better understand how urban resilience can be improved using asset management and disaster risk reduction methods (see Figure 1). The structure comprises several parts, each built on previous ones to form a clear overview of the research.
The first part is the Introduction, where the main ideas of the thesis are explained. It discusses why it is important to make cities stronger and more resilient against disasters, both natural and man-made. The introduction also outlines the main goals of the research. It explains that the thesis will focus on using risk management and asset management techniques to protect cities and help them recover quickly from disasters. This section sets up the key questions and challenges that the research will address.
The next section is the Literature Review, which looks at what has already been studied about urban resilience, asset management, and disaster risk reduction. This section gives an overview of existing methods and tools, both old and new. It also discusses the use of technologies like GeoAI (Geospatial Artificial Intelligence) and spatial analysis in predicting and managing risks. By reviewing the current state of knowledge, this chapter identifies gaps in the research that need to be filled, which leads to the development of new methods in this thesis.
Following the literature review is the Methodologies chapter, which explains the specific tools and frameworks created or used in the research. First, the Risk-Informed Asset-Centric Process (RIACT) is introduced. This is a method that combines risk assessment with asset management to decide which parts of a city are most important and should be prioritized in disaster planning. Next, the Geospatial Urban Resilience Evaluation System (G-URES) is explained. This system helps to evaluate how resilient different areas of a city are, based on their location and infrastructure. Finally, the Urban Resilience Index (URI) is described. The URI is a tool used to measure how well a city can handle and recover from disasters, giving a clear way to compare resilience across different areas.
In the Case Studies chapter, these tools are applied to real-world examples. The first case study looks at earthquake risks in a city and uses the RIACT framework to assess vulnerabilities and suggest ways to improve resilience. The second case study focuses on flood risk, using the GeoAI model to predict which areas are most likely to be affected by flooding. The third case study examines storm risks and uses both G-URES and the URI to evaluate how well critical infrastructure, like roads, can handle these risks. These case studies show how the methods developed in the thesis can be used to address different types of disasters in real situations.
The Strategies for Risk Mitigation section builds on the findings from the case studies to propose practical strategies for managing risks related to earthquakes, floods, and storms. These strategies are designed to help cities improve their resilience by taking into account both physical infrastructure and environmental factors. The strategies also include measures for adapting to climate change, ensuring that the solutions are long-term and inclusive.
The final section of the thesis is the Conclusions and Future Work. This chapter summarizes the key findings of the research and reflects on how well the proposed methods worked in improving urban resilience. It also suggests directions for future research, including expanding the methods to cover more types of disasters and urban assets. The thesis concludes by emphasizing the importance of continuing to develop and apply new tools and strategies to make cities more resilient in the face of growing risks.

2. Conceptual Construct:

Urban resilience addresses the capacity of cities to withstand and recover from various risks, including natural disasters and man-made threats. It involves understanding how these risks impact critical assets like infrastructure, services, and communities. A resilient city effectively manages these assets and adapts to changing conditions.

Systematic Literature Review:

This review examined Scopus literature on urban resilience, focusing on the interplay between risks, assets, and resilience-building strategies. The analysis reveals a significant increase in research since 2017, particularly within environmental science, social sciences, and engineering. Key themes identified include risk assessment, asset management, adaptation strategies, and the integration of technology.

General Concepts:

This thesis proposes a framework for urban resilience centered on risk-informed, asset-centric strategies. It integrates disaster risk assessment (natural and man-made hazards), critical asset management (infrastructure and services), and decision support tools (GIS, data analysis, and scenario planning) to enhance the resilience and sustainability of urban systems.

Risk and Risk Management - ISO 31000:

Cities face significant risks from both natural (e.g., earthquakes, floods) and man-made (e.g., cyberattacks, industrial accidents) hazards. These risks cause substantial economic, social, and humanitarian consequences. Effective risk management, aligned with ISO 31000, involves assessing potential hazards, developing mitigation strategies, and engaging stakeholders.

Asset and Asset Management - ISO 55000:

Urban assets, including infrastructure and intangible resources, are essential for city function. Effective asset management, aligned with ISO 55000, requires understanding asset lifecycles, optimizing investments, and mitigating risks. Interdependencies between assets must be considered to prevent cascading failures.

Integrating Risk and Asset Management:

Integrating risk and asset management is crucial for building resilient cities. This involves coordinated planning, resource allocation, and the use of advanced technologies to identify and mitigate risks, prioritizing critical assets. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of this integrated approach.

Urban Resilience and Sustainability - SDGs:

Urban resilience and sustainability are interconnected and essential for achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly Goals 9 and 11. Resilient cities effectively manage risks and assets while promoting sustainable development.

Decision Science in Urban Resilience:

Decision science provides methods to support informed decision-making in urban resilience. Techniques such as Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM), stochastic analysis, and community-based approaches are valuable tools for evaluating and prioritizing resilience strategies.

Geospatial Artificial Intelligence:

Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI) offer powerful tools for managing and visualizing spatial data. GeoAI enhances risk prediction, asset monitoring, and resource allocation for building urban resilience.

Related Previous Developments:

Several frameworks and standards (ISO 37123, ISO/TR 22845, IIMM, Anatomy of Asset Management, Sendai Framework, 100RC, CRF, UN-Habitat Scorecard) offer guidelines for measuring and improving urban resilience. These contribute to a growing body of knowledge, but a universally applicable framework integrating these approaches is still lacking.

Urban Resilience Stages:

Assessing urban resilience requires considering distinct stages: preparedness, resistance, recovery, and adaptation. Evaluating and enhancing resilience across these phases leads to a more robust and adaptable urban system.

ISO 37123:2019:

ISO 37123 provides a framework of indicators for measuring and improving urban resilience to diverse disruptions. It promotes comparable and verifiable data for enhancing city services and quality of life.

ISO/TR 22845:2020:

ISO/TR 22845 guides organizations in integrating resilience principles into their security and management systems. It emphasizes adaptability, agility, and continuous improvement.

The IIMM provides practical guidance for implementing infrastructure asset management systems, encompassing planning, lifecycle management, and decision-making processes.

Anatomy of Asset Management - IAM:

The IAM’s Anatomy of Asset Management provides a framework for understanding and implementing asset management, emphasizing value-driven approaches, lifecycle considerations, and organizational alignment.

Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030:

The Sendai Framework is a global agreement that outlines priorities for action to reduce disaster risk and build resilience. It emphasizes prevention, preparedness, and recovery strategies.

100 Resilient Cities:

The 100RC initiative supported cities in developing resilience strategies and fostering collaboration, but faced challenges with long-term funding and community involvement.

City Resilience Framework and Index:

The CRF and CRI offer a simplified approach to urban resilience planning and assessment, facilitating self-assessment and collaborative efforts.

UN-Habitat Disaster Resilience Scorecard:

The UN-Habitat Scorecard assists cities in assessing and improving their disaster preparedness, promoting stakeholder engagement and identifying areas for improvement.

Urban Resilience Evaluation System:

URES provides a detailed, asset-specific evaluation framework that supplements city-wide resilience assessments.

Supportive Tools:

This research utilizes Entropy Weighting and Random Forest, objective and data-driven methods for data analysis and predictive modelling respectively, improving the reliability of findings.

Entropy Weighting:

Entropy weighting objectively assigns weights to criteria based on their variability in data, providing a systematic approach for multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM).

Random Forest:

Random Forest is a machine learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees for improved prediction accuracy, particularly useful in predicting flood risks in road networks.

Review on Adaptation Measures and Adjusting it for Flood Risk on Road Network:

This section reviews climate adaptation measures, clustering them into physical infrastructure, ecosystem restoration, water management, policy and planning, and health and social measures. These measures are then tailored to address flood risk in road networks.

Final Remarks:

While significant progress has been made in understanding and measuring urban resilience, a more comprehensive and data-driven framework is needed, integrating existing knowledge and addressing identified gaps. Such a framework would greatly enhance cities' ability to build resilient and sustainable environments.

3	Proposed methodologies
This section introduces a structured approach to improving urban resilience (UR), addressing the second research question (Q2). Three methodologies are integrated to identify, analyze, and manage risks while structuring resilience measures into actionable stages.
The process begins with the Risk-Informed Asset-Centric Process (RIACT). RIACT is used to structure the problem by focusing on critical assets and identifying risks linked to their vulnerabilities. To enhance the effectiveness of RIACT, geospatial data is incorporated through the Geospatial Urban Resilience Evaluation System (G-URES). This addition allows spatial patterns of risk and exposure to be analyzed, improving the accuracy of assessments and decision-making.
As the process moves into the evaluation phase, a framework is required to stage resilience-building efforts into clear phases. To achieve this, the Preparation, Endurance, Recovery, and Adaptation (PERA) framework is applied. PERA separates the elements of urban resilience into manageable stages, ensuring that measures are grouped and nested logically for better planning and execution. This method ensures a coherent approach from pre-event preparation to long-term adaptation.
The methodologies presented here aim to create a systematic pathway for enhancing resilience, enabling cities to address complex risks and recover more effectively after disruptions.
3.1	Risk-Informed Asset-Centric (RIACT) 
This section discusses how urban resilience can be enhanced by integrating risk and asset management principles. The IAM's "Anatomy of Asset Management" recognizes resilience as a critical aspect of modern asset management, especially given the increasing prevalence of climate change and other disruptive events (The Institute of Asset Management (IAM), 2024). The Anatomy of Asset Management highlights the need for organizations to develop resilience plans for critical and social infrastructure, assessing current asset states and modelling exposures to climate change to inform mitigation strategies. It emphasizes the importance of futureproofing assets to ensure they can continue providing essential services in an uncertain future (The Institute of Asset Management (IAM), 2024).
Beyond disaster recovery, the Anatomy of Asset Management encourages organizations to build resilience into their assets and systems from the outset. This includes incorporating resilience considerations into strategic planning, risk management, and life cycle activities. The document specifically outlines resilience analysis, which involves identifying threats, evaluating impacts, setting recovery targets, and developing and testing contingency plans. By integrating resilience into all stages of asset management, organizations can better withstand disruptions and ensure the continued delivery of essential functions and services.
Based on background research on the body of knowledge and diverse insights that we reviewed on previous part, we're introducing the Risk-Informed Asset-Centric (RIACT), as the main contribution of this thesis, which process is based on ISO 31000 and connects risk management with UR. It focuses on managing risks to key assets, such as infrastructure or buildings, while also considering how to strengthen urban systems. The process further validated using elements from global standards as ISO 55000 (ISO 55000, 2014), The International Infrastructure Management Manual (IIMM) (IPWEA, 2015), IAM's " Anatomy of Asset Management” (The Institute of Asset Management, Management and The Institute of Asset Management, 2015)," and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030) (UNDRR, 2015), which help define risk priorities and actions. By combining these guidelines, RIACT offers a way to understand and manage risks while considering cost and system performance.
The RIACT steps shown on Figure 19 as begins with defining the "Scope, Context, and Criteria," which helps set goals and understand what needs to be done. Next is "Identification," which involves finding risks and understanding how they might affect specific assets. 
 
Figure 21. RIACT process for urban resilience
Then comes "Analysis," where risks are studied in more detail, looking at the likelihood of events and their possible effects. "Evaluation" compares these risks to the goals set earlier to decide which actions are necessary. "Treatment" focuses on what actions to take, such as reducing, avoiding, or transferring risks. There are also ongoing processes for monitoring, communication, and recording information to ensure the system works well over time.
This process works closely with the Geospatial Urban Resilience Evaluation System (G-URES) and Preparation, Endurance, Recovery, and Adaptation (PERA) frameworks which is going to be discussed in the next section as complementary element of the RIACT. Together, they create a system that helps cities plan for disruptions, manage risks, and recover after events. By linking asset-focused risk management to resilience planning, RIACT supports cities in improving their ability to respond to and recover from challenges.
The RIACT process provides a structured approach to enhance urban resilience by systematically managing risks associated with critical assets. The first step in this process is defining the scope, context, and criteria. The scope specifies the level of focus, such as a continent, country, city, or municipality as generally macro level and micro level. This ensures that the process is tailored to the relevant geographical or organizational boundaries. The context involves identifying the types of risks, such as floods or fires, and the assets exposed to those risks, such as bridges or buildings. These factors provide a basis for understanding the environment in which risks occur. The criteria define the parameters for risk evaluation, guiding consistent decision-making throughout the process.
Once the foundational elements are established, the next stage is identification, which involves recognizing the risks that could affect the defined scope. This stage focuses on understanding disasters, risks, and hazards to which assets are exposed. It also includes assessing the exposure of the asset system, which highlights vulnerabilities within the urban infrastructure. Identifying these risks ensures that no significant threats are overlooked and allows for the systematic documentation of potential disruptions.
Following identification, the process moves to analysis, where the focus shifts to examining the identified risks. Analysis begins by determining the likelihood of risks occurring, which involves assessing the probability of events based on underlying factors. The analysis also evaluates the potential impact of each risk, including its effects on urban systems and critical functions. By understanding both likelihood and impact, this stage provides a clear picture of the nature and extent of risks. 
To make this stage measurable, a proper indicator system is required, as introduced in previous studies. The role of these indicators is to provide a structured and quantifiable way to assess different aspects of the process. An effective indicator system ensures that data is not only relevant but also readily available and adaptable for integration with other indicators. This adaptability is critical for creating a comprehensive weighing system that balances multiple factors in risk assessment and resilience planning. By using such indicators, organizations can track progress, identify gaps, and support evidence-based decision-making.
Various indicator systems will be discussed in the next section, such as ISO 37123:2019, the City Resilience Index (CRI), and the Urban Resilience Evaluation System (URES) (ARUP, 2014; ISO 37123, 2019; Duarte et al., 2022; Rezvani et al., 2022). URES uses a structure of dimensions, indicators, and parameters to evaluate urban resilience as it is fully explained on the next section based on previous studies (Duarte et al., 2022; Rezvani et al., 2022), and this thesis adds dimensionality and in the next section a the other methodology we will add geospatial capabilities to them. Planners and engineers can choose indicators from these systems to define and frame the problem and determine the necessary solutions. It is important to maintain a balance because there are barriers such as data availability and the ability to perform data wrangling, which is sensitive and tedious work. They should first check from a broader perspective and then narrow down to the indicators that cover their problem with the minimal set of indicators for which they can provide a complete dataset. Then, they can move forward to other stages.
The information from the analysis stage feeds into evaluation, where risks are compared against the criteria defined earlier. This stage helps prioritize risks based on their urgency and significance. Evaluation often aligns with the PERA stages (Preparation, Endurance, Recovery, and Adaptation), allowing for a structured approach to resilience planning. This step ensures that organizations allocate their resources and efforts to risks that have the most significant potential to disrupt critical functions.
The next stage, treatment, focuses on addressing the prioritized risks through appropriate actions. Treatment options include mitigation, transferring risk to other entities, accepting risks after careful consideration, or avoiding risks altogether. This stage also emphasizes balancing cost, risk, and performance (CRP) to ensure efficient resource utilization. By implementing these measures, organizations aim to reduce vulnerabilities and improve their capacity to manage disruptions.
Two parallel processes—monitoring and review, and communication and consultation—occur throughout all stages of the RIACT process. Monitoring involves continuously checking the status of risks and the effectiveness of implemented controls. This ensures that the risk management process remains relevant and responsive to changing conditions. At the same time, communication and consultation engage both internal and external stakeholders, providing transparency and fostering collaboration across different levels of decision-making.
The final stage is recording and reporting, which involves documenting the outcomes of the entire process. This step ensures that the risk management efforts are well-documented and accessible to stakeholders for reference and future improvement. By integrating all these components, the RIACT process creates a comprehensive framework for understanding, managing, and addressing risks in urban environments. This approach helps urban systems maintain their functions, adapt to changes, and recover from disruptions effectively.
The Table 2 and By applying these standards throughout the entire life cycle of assets, we can enhance the resilience of urban systems. This involves not just preparing for disaster recovery but embedding resilience into the strategic planning and daily operations of urban infrastructure. Given the increasing challenges posed by climate change and other disruptions, an approach that combines risk assessment, strategic resilience planning, and life cycle management is essential. This integrated approach ensures that urban systems can maintain their critical functions and services, adapting to and recovering from unforeseen events effectively.
The International Standard ISO 55000:2014 focuses on asset management and provides a robust framework that directly supports the RIACT process, enhancing urban resilience (ISO 55000, 2014). ISO 55000 emphasizes a risk-based approach to asset management, which aligns with the systematic nature of RIACT. It underscores the importance of understanding the organizational context, including stakeholder needs, regulatory requirements, and the operating environment. This step aligns with the initial stage of RIACT, setting a clear scope for risk assessment and defining the criteria for evaluating risks. Furthermore, ISO 55000 highlights the significance of identifying assets and understanding their value, which supports the identification of potential risks associated with these assets.
Table 3 below shows how the RIACT process, which is based on ISO 31000, connects with other important frameworks and standards for managing assets and building resilience. These frameworks include ISO 55000, IIMM, IAM's "Anatomy of Asset Management," and the Sendai Framework. Each row in the table represents a key part of the RIACT process and explains how it relates to similar ideas in the other frameworks. 
By comparing these different approaches, we can see that the RIACT process covers all the main areas that experts think are important for managing assets and reducing risks. This comparison helps us understand why each part of the RIACT process is necessary and how it fits into the bigger picture of asset management and resilience.

Looking at the table, we can see that all the frameworks agree on the importance of understanding the context, identifying assets and risks, analyzing and evaluating those risks, and taking action to manage them. They also all emphasize the need to keep monitoring and reviewing the situation, as well as communicating with everyone involved and keeping good records. This alignment across different frameworks shows that the RIACT process is built on solid principles that are widely accepted in the field. It gives us confidence that using the RIACT process can help cities and organizations manage their assets more effectively and become more resilient to disasters and other challenges they might face}
The RIACT, also follows the principles of risk management as outlined in ISO 31000. RIACT provides a clear structure, reflecting the need for a systematic approach to risk management. Its stages—scope definition, context setting, risk identification, analysis, evaluation, and treatment—offer a coherent process for understanding and addressing risks. This structure enables consistent application across different contexts and supports decision-making that is both structured and transparent. The methodology also includes monitoring and reporting steps, which align with the principle of continual improvement, ensuring that the risk management process remains responsive over time.
The methodology allows for customization by focusing on the context in which it is applied. The first step in defining the scope, context, and criteria ensures that RIACT is tailored to specific urban environments. This adaptability allows cities to account for their unique conditions, ensuring that risk management efforts are aligned with local needs and priorities. By offering flexibility in the application of standardized processes, RIACT strikes a balance between global best practices and local relevance.
Inclusivity as another principle of the risk management is supported by RIACT, particularly through its emphasis on communication and consultation. This ensures that stakeholders are engaged throughout the risk management process, which improves transparency and decision-making. Involving relevant parties from the start also promotes collaboration, making it more likely that risk management strategies will be supported and implemented effectively. As just to have more complementary alignment on the risk management principles, its required for recognizing the importance of human and cultural factors allows the methodology to address the social dimensions of resilience, which can influence how risks are perceived and managed as the likelihood and impact, in the analysis section that need to select an evaluation system.
The RIACT framework is also designed with dynamism in mind, reflecting the fact that urban risks evolve over time. Through continuous monitoring and review, the methodology ensures that risk management strategies remain effective as conditions change. This flexibility enables the framework to adapt to new risks and emerging challenges, supporting long-term resilience in the face of uncertainty and change.
RIACT emphasizes the use of the best available information in its decision-making process. The framework supports data-driven analysis to evaluate the likelihood and impact of risks, ensuring that decisions are informed by accurate, up-to-date information. This reliance on high-quality data helps prioritize resources and guide risk mitigation efforts more effectively, maintaining a balance between resource allocation and risk reduction.
Finally, the RIACT methodology supports continual improvement by encouraging the regular review of risk management strategies and outcomes. The inclusion of monitoring and reporting allows organizations to assess their approach over time and make adjustments where necessary. This principle of ongoing evaluation ensures that the framework remains relevant as urban systems evolve, making it a practical tool for enhancing resilience in dynamic environments.
RIACT provides a comprehensive, adaptable, and inclusive approach to urban resilience. By integrating risk management principles into asset management practices, it supports cities in managing risks and building the capacity to adapt to future challenges. Through its structure, flexibility, use of data, and focus on continual improvement, RIACT contributes to creating more resilient urban environments.
3.2	Preparation, Endurance, Recovery, and Adapt (PERA)
Based on research on the body of knowledge and diverse insights that we did on previous part, we're introducing the Preparation, Endurance, Recovery, and Adapt (PERA) stages framework as a supportive basis of our main methodology RIACT which. 
The PERA methodology is grounded in the perspective of UR, which emphasizes the dynamic nature of urban systems and their capacity to respond to various challenges (Meerow et al., 2016; ‘Conclusion: Stages and Scales of Urban Resilience Strategies’, 2016; Zhang, Zhang and Li, 2021; Lowe et al., 2024).
PERA has various stages such as Preparation, Endurance, Recovery, and Adaptation, which are designed to guide urban resilience efforts effectively. Each stage will address a critical phase in dealing with disruptions as natural and man-made disaster aiming to enhancing UR.
This structured approach ensures a comprehensive and adaptable strategy for UR. By integrating these phases, we create a robust foundation that not only addresses immediate needs but also prepares for future challenges. This framework will be applied in our case studies, ensuring a practical and actionable approach to enhancing UR.
The stages of UR as PERA are Prepare, Endurance, Recovery, and Adapt, are key for understanding how cities respond to disruptions, cope with shocks, and reduce vulnerabilities (Figure 13).
 
Figure 15. The PERA (Preparation (Awareness), Endurance (Absorption), Recovery (Restoration), and Adaptation (Transformation)) stages of the urban resilience
The Preparation phase aims to increase knowledge and readiness for possible disruptions. This includes informing communities and organizing plans for different situations. During a disruption, the Endurance phase assesses the capacity to handle and manage its effects. The goal is to reduce harm and keep vital operations running. Afterward, the Recovery phase works on fixing damaged services and structures. It focuses on returning to regular operations efficiently. In the final stage, the Adaptation phase uses past experiences to strengthen resilience, applying insights and improving systems for the future.
The first step, Preparation, focuses on planning ahead and being ready for potential hazards. It’s about making sure cities, infrastructure, and communities can handle challenges when they come. This includes activities like reducing disaster risks, creating mitigation plans, and setting up systems for early warnings. Cities also focus on educating people, building skills, situational awareness and putting systems in place to manage emergencies before they happen. The goal here is to lower risks by taking preventive actions and helping communities to understand what to do in emergencies.
For instance, Rio de Janeiro (Figure 14), Brazil, has an Operations Center that combines efforts from different public agencies. This system has improved their emergency response time by 30%. Similarly, Copenhagen, Denmark, tests urban design solutions in real-world settings through its "Street Lab," helping the city prepare for climate-related challenges.
 
Figure 16. The Rio Operations Center (COR) 
Endurance is about how well a city can absorb the shock of a disruption and keep functioning, ensuring that essential services—like hospitals, transport systems, and energy networks—can continue to operate during emergencies. Cities may use natural systems, such as wetlands, or build extra capacity into services to act as safety nets.
For example, Singapore uses telehealth to make sure healthcare remains available even when disruptions occur (Figure 15). The city also relies on digital systems to keep government services running during emergencies. Zurich, Switzerland, uses smart grids and energy-efficient technologies to reduce the stress on its infrastructure during crises (see Link).
 
Figure 17. The National University Health System (NUHS) said it conducts over 80,000 teleconsultations each year across its cluster of healthcare institutions since it launched its service in 2020. (Photo: Alexandra Hospital) 
Recovery is about bringing systems and services back to normal after a disruption. This stage focuses on quick actions and using resources effectively to repair and rebuild. Recovery planning often includes strategies to restart essential services while minimizing long-term effects. Revitalizing urban areas can also help cities recover economically and socially.
For example, Johannesburg (Figure 16), South Africa, revitalized its city center with urban regeneration projects, reducing vacant properties and boosting economic stability.
 
Figure 18. Johannesburg, South Africa, revitalized its city center with urban regeneration projects, reducing vacant properties and boosting economic stability 
The last stage, Adaptation, involves learning from past disruptions and making changes to improve for the future. Cities use this stage to update systems, policies, and infrastructure so they are better prepared for future challenges like climate change or economic shifts.
Rotterdam has adopted a multi-layered model based on "living with water" to become a sponge city by 2100 (Figure 17). This adaptive approach includes four layers: flood prevention, spatial adaptation, emergency response, and resilient recovery1. This comprehensive strategy demonstrates how long-term planning and innovation can significantly enhance urban flood resilience.
 
Figure 19. Rotterdam multi-layered model "living with water" a sponge city by 2100
To assess resilience performance for each of these stages accurately, it is essential to consider the unique nature of each phase, and the varying timeframes involved (Table 1). The timeframes for resilience actions can differ greatly depending on the type of disruption. For example, during the Preparation stage, the response time might be just seconds or minutes, as seen in earthquakes or terrorist attacks. On the other hand, during a flood, storm or pandemic, the response time could range from hours to days, and sometimes even longer like weeks to months.
Table 3. Timescales Across PERA Stages for Different Disaster Types
Disaster	Preparation (Awareness)	Endurance (Absorption)	Recovery (Restoration)	Adaptation (Transformation)
Earthquake (The World Bank, 2024)
Minutes (seconds to minutes for immediate awareness and warnings)	Seconds to minutes (Immediate shaking and impact absorption)	Days to weeks (Restoring basic services, infrastructure, and housing)	Years to decades (Long-term changes in building codes, retrofitting structures, infrastructure resilience)
Flood, Landslide (Dijkstra et al., 2017; Weber et al., 2019)
Hours to days (Warning systems and evacuations take time)	Hours to days (Water absorption, damage control)	Weeks to months (Rebuilding, restoring utilities, infrastructure)	Years to decades (Urban planning, flood defense systems, and long-term changes in land use and construction practices)
Wildfire (Ready for wildfire, 2019; Ager et al., 2021)
Hours to days (Forecasting and evacuation plans)	Hours to days (Fire containment and immediate response)	Weeks to months (Restoring homes, infrastructure, and services)	Years to decades (Fire-resistant infrastructure, land management policies, restoration of ecosystems)
Ice Storm, Hurricane/Cyclone, Tornado (Ulak et al., 2018; Komljenovic, 2020; Zhao et al., 2024)
Hours to days (Early warnings and preparation)	Hours to days (Immediate power outages, transportation disruption)	Days to weeks (Restoring power, repairing transportation, emergency services)	Years to decades (Improved infrastructure design, resilient power grids, better urban planning for ice storm resilience)
Drought, Heatwave (Bachmair et al., 2017; Nishant et al., 2022; Atrigna et al., 2023) 
Months to years (Ongoing risk awareness, early warning systems)	Months (Slow depletion of resources, water conservation efforts)	Months to years (Restoring water supplies, agriculture, and ecosystems)	Years to decades (Improved water management, sustainable agricultural practices, drought-resilient crops)
	Hours to days (Monitoring and early warning)	Seconds to minutes (Immediate effects, damage to infrastructure)	Weeks to months (Infrastructure repair, emergency services)	Years to decades (Land use planning, slope stabilization techniques, and urban design to prevent landslides)
For example, Preparation in the form of awareness and early action and Endurance may require a much shorter timeframe compared to Recovery, which involves rebuilding systems. Similarly, Adaptation might span years, as it involves strategic long-term planning and transformation. By recognizing and evaluating these different timeframes, cities can create a more comprehensive and effective resilience strategy, ultimately improving their ability to cope with future challenges and disruptions.
This variability means that each stage requires a distinct approach to evaluation. In the Preparation stage, the speed and effectiveness of early warning systems or disaster preparedness measures need to be assessed in real-time. In contrast, the Recovery stage requires evaluating how quickly the city can restore services and ensure infrastructure resilience. Adaptation, however, focuses on longer-term strategies, assessing how effectively cities are learning from past events and incorporating nature-based solutions or smart technologies to reduce future vulnerabilities.
Figure 18 shows the interconnected structure of the PERA framework for UR. The diagram presents two types of connections: the main cycle shown in grey arrows and the enhancement paths shown in yellow arrows.
 
Figure 20. The PERA connectivity stages and information flow (preparation, endurance, recovery, adaptation)
The PERA framework is designed as a dynamic, cyclical process where cities continually improve their resilience through interconnected stages. The gray arrows in the framework represent the main cycle, highlighting the sequential flow from one stage to the next. The process begins with Preparation, where cities establish foundational readiness through infrastructure development, risk management, and planning. When disruptions occur, the cycle shifts to Endurance, where cities absorb and respond to impacts. After the disruption, the focus moves to Recovery, emphasizing restoration and rebuilding efforts. Finally, the cycle advances to Adaptation, where lessons from past events inform strategies for future improvement. This stage connects the end of one cycle to the start of another, looping back into Preparation and creating a continuous progression.
The yellow arrows emphasize Adaptation's unique role as the framework’s enhancement hub. Unlike the other stages, Adaptation is not limited to completing the cycle—it actively feeds knowledge and improvements into every phase.
1.	Adaptation informs Preparation by incorporating lessons learned and innovative solutions into updated risk management plans and infrastructure designs. For instance, new technologies or policies developed during Adaptation redefine the baseline for preparedness.
2.	It enhances Endurance by refining response mechanisms and building systems capable of handling a wider range of shocks. Adaptive measures, such as modular systems or diversified resources, strengthen cities' abilities to absorb and manage disruptions.
3.	For Recovery, Adaptation optimizes processes by integrating “build back better” principles. Post-event analyses guide restoration efforts, ensuring that rebuilt systems are more robust and aligned with long-term resilience goals.
This dual role makes Adaptation a central learning and improvement mechanism, transforming city responses at every stage. The yellow arrows in the framework visually represent how Adaptation fosters this flow of knowledge and enhancement across all stages.
Cities need to assess their resilience performance in each PERA stage separately. This allows for a clearer understanding of how each phase—Preparation, Endurance, Recovery, and Adaptation—contributes to the city’s overall resilience. Each stage has distinct characteristics and timelines, which must be carefully evaluated to ensure a holistic understanding of urban resilience. 
3.3	Geospatial Urban Resilience Evaluation System (G-URES)
After establishing the foundations of urban resilience through the PERA and RIACT frameworks and reviewing the previous evaluation frameworks in part 1, next is the development of a more dynamic and precise evaluation system for assessing resilience which is working in all the stages requires in the RIACT process where we have the data and there is need to process data in geospatial dimension. This system must be adaptable to both international standards and local realities, ensuring inclusivity and flexibility while providing an accurate, data-driven approach to understanding resilience. In which, we introduced the Geospatial Urban Resilience Evaluation System (G-URES), a GIS based evaluation system that improving the previously reviewed URES in terms of having Geo-spatiality and using it across various scenarios and it is designed to support cities in their efforts to identify vulnerabilities, evaluate risks, and enhance their capacity to recover and adapt to challenges posed by both natural and man-made hazards.
G-URES incorporates geospatial data as a key component in assessing and managing risks. The integration of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) into the system allows for better spatial analysis and data processing. G-URES provides structured, data-driven geospatial data as an important layer to assess resilience in a more digestible way for researchers, urban planners, and organizations that are concerned with UR. This capability to incorporate location-specific factors—such as proximity to hazards, terrain features, and critical infrastructure—helps ensure that urban resilience assessments are more accurate and relevant. 
The G-URES methodology as shown on Figure 20, follows a clear three-step process: Input Data, Processing, and Output.
 
Figure 22. G-URES flow chart - from raw data to actionable urban resilience insights
The Input Data phase encompasses a structured collection of various types of information critical for analyzing urban resilience. It is categorized into four main areas: Disaster data, Asset data, Statistical data, and Geospatial data. Each category contributes unique insights into the risks and vulnerabilities of urban systems. Together, they provide the foundation for the subsequent analysis and modeling stages, ensuring the assessment process captures the complexities of urban environments.
Figure 19 outlines the components of the input data. The first category, Disaster data, includes historical records of past events, such as floods, storms, or droughts, and hazard-specific datasets that focus on particular risks like earthquakes or landslides. These datasets reveal the frequency, magnitude, and spatial distribution of disasters, forming the basis for understanding future risk probabilities and potential impacts. The second category, Asset data, focuses on the physical systems and infrastructure essential for urban functionality. This includes information on the locations of critical infrastructure such as hospitals, schools, and transportation hubs. Additionally, it examines the exposure of these assets to identified risks, highlighting potential vulnerabilities that could disrupt urban services during disaster events.

 
Figure 23. G-URES input options
The third and fourth categories, Statistical data and Geospatial data, provide complementary perspectives on urban systems. Statistical data incorporates socio-economic indicators and population demographics to evaluate social vulnerabilities. Geospatial data offers spatial layers such as satellite imagery, topographic maps, land-use information, and infrastructure age. These datasets allow for detailed spatial analysis, such as identifying flood-prone zones or mapping the proximity of infrastructure to hazardous natural features. When integrated, these diverse inputs create a comprehensive understanding of urban risks, enabling targeted resilience measures.
The Processing phase is where collected data is refined, integrated, and analyzed to generate meaningful insights for urban resilience planning. This phase is divided into four key components: Data wrangling, GIS data integration, Data analysis, and Modeling. Each component plays a distinct role in transforming raw data into actionable insights, ensuring the robustness and accuracy of subsequent outputs.
Figure 22 illustrates the steps involved in the processing phase. The first step, Data wrangling, involves cleaning and standardizing datasets. This ensures consistency across diverse sources and resolves issues such as missing data or incompatible formats. For example, inconsistencies in data formats, like mismatched coordinate systems in geospatial datasets, are addressed to prepare the data for further analysis. Through these steps, the datasets become reliable and suitable for integration into a single analytical framework.
 
Figure 24. G-URES processing options
The next step, GIS data integration, focuses on overlaying spatial datasets and merging risk and asset system layers. By using GIS tools, relationships between different spatial elements—such as infrastructure locations and high-risk areas—can be visualized. For instance, overlaying hazard maps with critical infrastructure locations helps identify areas of high exposure. This step allows urban planners to see how risks are distributed geographically and how they intersect with key urban systems.
The final steps, Data analysis and Modeling, involve identifying spatial patterns, analyzing risk hotspots, and simulating disaster scenarios. In data analysis, spatial trends such as clusters of high vulnerability are identified to prioritize risk management strategies. In the modeling phase, weighting systems are applied for scenario analysis, and predictive models, such as regression or machine learning algorithms, are developed to forecast potential impacts. These simulations provide a deeper understanding of how disasters might unfold and help policymakers craft effective resilience strategies.
The Output phase translates the processed data into practical tools for decision-making. One key deliverable is location-specific assessments, which evaluate urban areas based on their risks and resilience capacities. Vulnerability and resilience maps offer a spatial representation of hazards and their interaction with populations and infrastructure. For example, maps that highlight flood zones overlapping with hospitals or schools help authorities prioritize these areas for flood protection measures and emergency planning.
In addition to maps, scenario-based reports provide an understanding of how different disaster scenarios could unfold. These reports simulate the effects of potential events on urban systems, illustrating disruptions in transportation, energy supplies, or public services. Such outputs enable policymakers to plan for specific contingencies and develop targeted interventions. By offering clear and actionable information, these outputs support resource allocation, improve public preparedness, and contribute to the development of more resilient urban systems.
The outputs of the G-URES framework are organized into three main categories: Location-specific assessment, Vulnerability and resilience maps, and Scenario-based reports. These outputs provide actionable insights to urban planners, policymakers, and local authorities by transforming raw data into tools that inform decision-making. Each category addresses a distinct aspect of urban resilience, from evaluating localized risks to projecting the impacts of potential disasters, enabling a comprehensive approach to disaster risk management.
Figure 23 illustrates the structure of these outputs, beginning with location-specific assessments, which analyze risks and vulnerabilities within urban areas. This involves identifying and prioritizing high-risk zones, assessing geographic vulnerabilities that may contribute to disaster impacts, and evaluating the potential consequences of these events. By pinpointing critical risk factors and their potential effects, these assessments provide a foundation for targeted interventions and resource allocation.
 
Figure 25. G-URES output options
The second category, vulnerability and resilience maps, integrates spatial data with hazard information to visualize how risks interact with urban systems. These maps include heatmaps of high-risk zones to highlight areas requiring immediate attention and overlays that combine hazard zones with infrastructure networks such as schools or hospitals. Additionally, vulnerability assessments by infrastructure type offer insights into how different systems, such as roads or water supply networks, may be affected under specific disaster scenarios.
The third category is scenario-based reports, which simulate and evaluate the outcomes of various resilience strategies. These reports provide recommendations for effective measures, outline actionable steps for local governments, and explore the feasibility of proposed solutions under different conditions. By comparing multiple disaster scenarios, they help decision-makers understand trade-offs and potential outcomes, guiding them toward informed and practical resilience planning.
At its core, G-URES seeks to address the need for a system that can assess resilience at both the macro and micro levels. The system's ability to scale up to evaluate city-wide risks, as well as its capacity to zoom in on individual buildings or infrastructure assets, ensures that resilience planning can be both comprehensive and specific. This dual approach allows cities to evaluate risks that affect them broadly while also focusing on critical areas that might be more vulnerable to disruption. For instance, G-URES can identify city-wide flood risks by analysing topographic and land characteristic data subjected to both national level maps or even each road section intrinsic probability of flood or evaluating the earthquake vulnerability of the various municipalities using open-source national statistical data.
The flexibility and adaptability of G-URES are further enhanced by, keeping in mind during the development, its alignment with key principles of risk management, as defined in ISO 31000. This includes principles such as integration, ensuring that G-URES can be incorporated into existing urban resilience strategies and risk management practices, as well as structure and comprehensiveness, which guides a systematic, approach to resilience evaluation. The ability to customize the system based on local needs ensures that G-URES can be applied across diverse contexts, whether in macro in micro level such as respectively city, or municipality wide, or individual assets like energy network or road network, more localized urban environments. This customization helps cities address unique challenges while still adhering to recognized standards, making G-URES an inclusive and versatile tool for urban resilience.
G-URES contributes to the different stages of urban resilience as outlined in the PERA framework—Preparation, Endurance, Recovery, and Adaptation—by providing a comprehensive, data-driven process for evaluating resilience across all stages. In the Preparation phase, G-URES helps cities map risks and vulnerabilities, using data from past disasters, climate models, and possible future scenarios. This analysis might involve studying historical earthquake or flood data to identify areas most at risk and understanding how climate change might exacerbate these threats. By combining these insights with geospatial data, G-URES offers a clearer picture of where the most vulnerable populations and infrastructure lie, supporting better-informed decision-making in planning and resource allocation.
During the Endurance phase, G-URES assesses the robustness of critical infrastructure and essential services to withstand disruptions. Using GIS and AI, the system can evaluate how well transportation networks, energy grids, and water supplies can continue to function under stress, offering insights into areas where infrastructure might require strengthening. For example, G-URES could assess the capacity of an energy grid to maintain supply during extreme weather events, such as heatwaves or storms, ensuring that essential services remain operational even in the face of adversity. By pinpointing the weaknesses in urban systems, G-URES allows cities to prioritize interventions that will have the greatest impact on enhancing resilience.
The Recovery phase benefits from G-URES by guiding the restoration of critical services after an event. In the aftermath of a disaster, rapid recovery is crucial, and G-URES offers tools to determine which infrastructure should be repaired or restored first. For example, following a flood, G-URES can assess which transportation routes are most critical for emergency response and prioritize their repair, ensuring that first responders have the access they need to deliver aid and facilitate recovery efforts. Additionally, G-URES can guide the restoration of public services, such as hospitals and schools, based on their importance to public health and safety.
In the Adaptation phase, G-URES plays a vital role in learning from past events and refining resilience strategies. By analyzing previous disruptions, such as earthquakes or floods, G-URES helps cities integrate lessons learned into their long-term planning. For example, if an earthquake revealed weaknesses in building structures, G-URES could help identify the most vulnerable areas and recommend updates to building codes or infrastructure designs. This continuous learning process ensures that cities are better prepared for future challenges, adapting their resilience strategies based on real-world experiences and evolving risks.
G-URES also promotes inclusivity by integrating community data into the evaluation process. Understanding the social dimensions of resilience is critical, as certain groups within a city may be more vulnerable to disruptions due to socio-economic factors, access to resources, or geographical location. By considering these factors, G-URES ensures that resilience measures are socially inclusive and tailored to the specific needs of different communities. This inclusivity is particularly important in urban areas, where inequality and access to resources can vary widely, and where resilience strategies must be designed to protect all citizens, especially the most vulnerable.
Finally, G-URES offers a standardized approach to urban resilience that is adaptable and scalable to different urban contexts. Whether applied in a large metropolitan city or a smaller urban area, G-URES can be customized to fit the unique characteristics of each location. Its adaptability ensures that cities of all sizes and types can benefit from its data-driven insights, providing a flexible framework for enhancing resilience across the globe. Furthermore, the integration of publicly available data sources, such as those on energy networks or transportation systems, further strengthens G-URES as a tool for urban resilience, making it easier for cities to access and incorporate relevant data into their decision-making processes.
3.4	Final remarks
This chapter presented a methodological framework for improving urban resilience. The PERA framework offers a structured, cyclical approach to managing disruptions, covering preparation, endurance, recovery, and adaptation. RIACT combines risk management with asset management, allowing for the systematic assessment and treatment of risks to critical urban assets. G-URES uses geospatial data and analysis to deliver a location-specific, data-driven method for evaluating and enhancing resilience. Together, these approaches form a strong basis for strengthening urban resilience.
The combined PERA-RIACT-G-URES framework addresses the complex challenges of urban resilience by incorporating various approaches. PERA sets the overall structure for handling disruptions, while RIACT focuses on asset-specific risks. G-URES adds the essential layer of spatial analysis. This integration helps cities not only prepare for and respond to disasters but also adapt and learn from past experiences, supporting continuous improvement in resilience planning.
The following chapters will explore how these methodologies can be applied in practice. Through case studies and real-world examples, the practical use of the framework will be demonstrated, showing how it can be implemented in urban settings. This application will help confirm the framework’s effectiveness and provide a deeper understanding of the factors that influence urban resilience. By connecting theory and practice, this research seeks to offer actionable tools for building more resilient cities.

5	Case study 1 – Earthquake risk
In this section, the RIACT decision-making process is applied to evaluate earthquake risk at the municipal level. Case study 1 focuses on earthquake-related risks and employs a RIACT process. RIACT is used considering the alignment of the PERA stages of the UR which was developed alongside RIACT in part two. This case study complemented, using the previously introduced methodology, by G-URES for data synthesis and weighted using Entropy method as explained in part one of supportive tools. 
5.1	Scope, context, and criteria
In this case study, we explore earthquake risk management across Portugal's municipal landscape, focusing on comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation strategies. The research concentrates on understanding seismic vulnerabilities within Portugal's 308 municipalities, examining the complex interactions between geological hazards and urban infrastructure. Municipalities serve as the primary unit of analysis, enabling a granular approach to risk evaluation that captures localized characteristics and potential challenges.
The context centers on earthquake risk, specifically analyzing near-field and far-field seismic activities that might impact Portuguese territories. Researchers will map potential scenarios, considering the country's medium seismic hazard profile, which indicates a 10% probability of potentially damaging earthquake occurrences within the next five decades. Critical assets under investigation include municipal infrastructure, population centers, and key structural systems that could experience disruption during seismic events.
Risk acceptance criteria will be determined through multiple parameters, emphasizing structural integrity, population safety, and economic resilience. Stakeholders will establish thresholds that prevent widespread infrastructure collapse, ensure minimal service interruption, and protect human life. The approach involves quantifying acceptable damage levels, determining compliance factors for buildings, and establishing magnitude tolerances that align with Portugal's specific geological and urban development contexts.
Methodologically, the case study will use G-URES, transferring seismic map data into standardized municipal assessment maps. These maps will process transforming technical data into actionable municipal-level insights. This systematic approach enables comprehensive risk understanding, facilitating targeted interventions and strategic planning across Portugal's diverse municipal environments.
5.2	Identification
G-URES serves as a complementary tool to the RIACT framework, enhancing data visualization, processing, and enabling location-specific assessments of vulnerabilities and resilience capacities in urban areas. The analysis involves a structured data-gathering process supported by diverse datasets, including earthquake information, demographic and socioeconomic data, and the HASC Naming Convention. This system integrates multiple types of data, such as statistical, disaster-related, and asset-specific information. In this case study, the asset systems being analyzed are municipalities.
Portugal is divided into 308 municipalities, each offering unique social and economic characteristics. To ensure a systematic understanding of these municipalities, the Hierarchical Administrative Subdivision Codes (HASC) system was implemented. This system uses a structured naming convention of letters and dots to uniquely identify each municipality within its district or region. For example, the code "PT.AV.AG" represents the municipality of Águeda in the Aveiro district (FAO, 2020).
The HASC system for Portugal follows a clear hierarchy. It begins with the country code "PT" to indicate Portugal. Next, it includes codes for the 18 districts and 2 autonomous regions, such as "PT.AV" for the Aveiro district, "PT.FA" for Faro, "PT.AC" for the Azores, and "PT.MA" for Madeira. The final level of detail adds two more letters to identify municipalities within these districts or regions, such as "PT.AV.AG" for Águeda in Aveiro or "PT.FA.AB" for Albufeira in Faro.
This coding system reflects Portugal's administrative structure, which includes 18 districts and 2 autonomous regions divided into 308 municipalities. Of these, 278 are located on the mainland, 19 in the Azores, and 11 in Madeira. By adopting the HASC naming convention, it becomes easier to organize and analyze administrative divisions at multiple levels.
In this analysis, the HASC system connecting municipal data with earthquake, demographic, and socioeconomic datasets. The coding allows researchers to overlay and compare diverse datasets with precision, ensuring a deeper understanding of the unique characteristics of each municipality. This approach enhances the clarity of findings, making the information more useful and accessible for decision-makers and stakeholders.
This study relies on earthquake data as its primary dataset. Information on both near-field (EC2) and far-field (EC1) seismic events was collected to examine Portugal's historical earthquake records (Wang et al., 2019; Oliveira, Gomes and Teves-Costa, 2023). To establish the geographical boundaries for analysis, geospatial data was sourced from Portugal's city border shapefile, which is available in the Global Administrative Areas (GADM) database. Demographic and socioeconomic data were gathered from the Instituto Nacional de Estatística (INE), Portugal's National Statistics Institute (Instituto Nacional de Estatística, 2021). These datasets form the foundation of the case study.
The study focuses on understanding the risks associated with both far-field (EC1) and near-field (EC2) earthquakes. It aims to identify areas most at risk by assessing the exposure of geographical regions and populations to seismic events. By integrating metrics for area and population through the entropy weighting method, as explained in Part 1, the study quantifies the potential scale and severity of impacts. This approach identifies the most susceptible regions (Martins, e Silva and Cabral, 2012; Burton, Silva and Eeri, 2016).
In the RIACT framework, G-URES plays a crucial role in analysing and evaluating urban resilience. It transforms raw datasets into actionable insights that support decision-making and policy development, as outlined in the methodology section. Python is used alongside the entropy weighting method for data processing. The specifics of the code and its explanation are covered in Part 1. Additionally, QGIS is applied to manage geospatial data, including its extraction, preprocessing, and spatial representation. These tools ensure detailed analysis and the creation of visual outputs that reflect the study’s findings.
The analysis addresses four key aspects: earthquake hazards, exposure, vulnerability, and resilience. It offers a comprehensive overview of areas with high disaster risk, regions with significant exposure, vulnerable municipalities, and communities showing strong resilience. This process enables the identification of critical regions requiring attention for better disaster preparedness and mitigation strategies.
The earthquake risk assessment reveals notable regional variations across Portugal, emphasizing the importance of area-specific preparedness and infrastructure planning tailored to the seismic activity of each region. As detailed in Figure 27, these differences are particularly evident when comparing the southern and southwestern regions, where risks are generally higher, to other parts of the country.



 
Figure 27. Map of Portugal's 308 municipalities depicting earthquake hazard
In the Aveiro region, covering municipalities from Águeda to Vale de Cambra, earthquake risk scores remain relatively consistent at 0.27. However, exceptions such as Arouca and Castelo de Paiva show lower scores of 0.18, reflecting reduced risk levels. The Azores region, in contrast, demonstrates significantly elevated risks, with municipalities like Angra do Heroísmo and Horta scoring as high as 1.0, indicating substantial vulnerability. Even within the Azores, some areas such as Corvo and Lajes das Flores exhibit slightly lower scores, averaging around 0.73.
Further variations are observed in Beja, where risk scores range between 0.45 and 0.55, though Odemira stands out with a higher score of 0.64. The Braga region, much like Aveiro, maintains relatively stable scores around 0.18, suggesting lower overall seismic risks. These variations underscore the need for localized risk management strategies to address the specific vulnerabilities of each region effectively.
These regional disparities in seismic risks are reflected in the varying levels of asset exposure across Portugal. The exposure is calculated using two main indicators: population and area size. These indicators are combined using the entropy weighting method, as described in Part 1, to ensure a balanced and objective assessment. The methodology assigns higher exposure values to municipalities with larger populations and greater areas. This approach applies a positive weighting, where higher population or larger area size contributes proportionally to higher exposure levels (see Figure 28).
In the Aveiro region, Santa Maria da Feira records the highest exposure at 0.236, due to its relatively larger population and area size compared to other municipalities. In contrast, Murtosa has a much lower exposure of 0.022, attributed to its smaller population and area. In the Azores, Ponta Delgada shows an exposure level of 0.146, reflecting its higher population density and geographical coverage, while Corvo, with a smaller population and area, has a significantly lower exposure of 0.002.
The Beja region also illustrates this relationship, with Odemira and Mértola registering the highest exposure levels at 0.324, due to their larger areas and populations. On the other hand, Barrancos has the lowest exposure value of 0.041, consistent with its smaller size and population. In Braga, the city itself exhibits a higher exposure level of 0.279, reflecting its higher population density and municipal area, while Vizela, with smaller dimensions, has an exposure value of 0.036.

5.3	Analysis
Following the establishment of the scope, context, and criteria for evaluating earthquake risk in Portuguese municipalities, the next crucial step within the RIACT framework is analysis. This stage involves a two-pronged approach: assessing the likelihood of seismic events and evaluating their potential impact. The likelihood assessment utilizes historical earthquake data and geological information to understand the probability and potential magnitude of future seismic events. This information provides a crucial baseline for understanding the inherent seismic risk each municipality faces.
Earthquakes in Portugal are a recurring phenomenon, influenced by the ongoing convergence of the Eurasian and African tectonic plates. This geological activity results in a moderate level of seismicity, with an average of 97 earthquakes of magnitude 4 or higher occurring within a 300km radius of Portugal every decade. Annually, this translates to approximately 9-10 noticeable seismic events, with the total number of earthquakes across all magnitudes reaching around 2,900.
A more detailed breakdown reveals the varying frequency of earthquakes based on magnitude. Portugal experiences around 261 earthquakes of magnitude 3 or higher, 34.8 earthquakes of magnitude 4 or higher, and 2.7 earthquakes of magnitude 5 or higher annually. This data underscores the importance of considering a range of earthquake magnitudes when assessing risk, as even lower magnitude events can contribute to cumulative damage and heighten vulnerabilities over time.
The spatial distribution of seismic activity in Portugal is not uniform. Certain regions experience a higher concentration of earthquake events, including the Lisbon region, the Algarve, Tagus Lezíria, the Setúbal Peninsula, and the Azores archipelago. This regional variation in seismicity highlights the need for location-specific risk assessments and mitigation strategies.
The frequency of more significant earthquakes, those with magnitudes above 5, provides another layer of understanding for risk assessment. On average, Portugal experiences 2.7 to 2.8 earthquakes exceeding magnitude 5 each year. Over the past decade, four earthquakes of magnitude 5 or greater have been recorded within 300km of Portugal, with the strongest reaching a magnitude of 5.4 in August 2024. While these higher magnitude events are less frequent, their potential for widespread damage and disruption necessitates careful consideration within the overall risk assessment.
The regions most susceptible to earthquakes in Portugal include the Lisbon urban area, the southern Algarve, the Azores archipelago, the offshore region south of mainland Portugal, and the Lower Tagus Valley. These areas' vulnerability stems from their proximity to active fault lines and tectonic plate boundaries, such as the Azores-Gibraltar Transform Fault. The southwest of Portugal, in particular, has been identified as a high-risk zone due to its complex geological characteristics.
Seismic risk assessments, such as those producing maps with a 10% probability of exceedance in 50 years, confirm the Lower Tagus Valley and southwest Portugal as the areas facing the highest seismic risk. These assessments consider factors beyond proximity to fault lines, including historical seismic activity, geological characteristics, and the vulnerability of building stock.
While the likelihood assessment provides a crucial understanding of earthquake probability, the impact assessment delves into the potential consequences of such events on each municipality. This involves considering the vulnerability of different municipalities based on a range of indicators. These indicators, selected for their relevance and adaptability to the Hierarchical Administrative Subdivision Codes (HASC) system, provide a standardized framework for comparing municipalities across Portugal. This standardized system, as discussed earlier, allows for precise data integration and analysis at the municipal level.
The vulnerability assessment, conducted using the G-URES framework, provides a spatially explicit view of how different municipalities might be affected by earthquake events. G-URES integrates various data sources, including statistical data from INE (Portugal's National Statistics Institute), to create vulnerability maps. These maps offer a visual representation of the relative vulnerability of each municipality, providing valuable insights for targeted interventions and resource allocation. A vulnerability map, generated through this process, provides a visual representation of the relative vulnerability of each municipality in Portugal. This map allows for easy identification of areas requiring particular attention in terms of risk mitigation and resilience-building efforts (see Figure 29).
 
Figure 29. Map of Portugal's 308 municipalities depicting vulnerability
5.4	Evaluation
After the analysis phase of the RIACT process, the next step is the evaluation phase. This stage focuses on identifying and implementing priority and necessary actions through the PERA stages, as outlined in the methodology section. The evaluation process bridges the insights gained during the analysis phase with actionable measures, ensuring a systematic and phased response to seismic risks.
The selected indicators—Municipal Revenue per Inhabitant, Upper Secondary Education Levels, Ageing Ratio, Housing Density, Population Density, Construction Activity, Fire Personnel per Capita, Hospitals per Capita, and Purchasing Power per Capita—were chosen based on their availability and accessibility as open-source data from Instituto Nacional de Estatística (INE). These indicators are adaptable to HASC coding, as detailed earlier in this case study, enabling consistent geographic analysis. The same objective Entropy Weighting System used in the previous analysis section was applied here to assign unbiased importance to each indicator. The results were then processed using the G-URES methodology, which structured the data through standardized input, processing, and output stages to ensure accuracy and reliability in resilience assessments.
In the Prepare stage, evaluation centers on assessing the readiness of communities and systems for earthquakes. Municipalities with higher revenue levels typically have better resources for post-disaster recovery, while communities with higher levels of education demonstrate improved preparedness and informed responses (Utah Disaster Resilience Strategies). However, a higher proportion of elderly residents may pose challenges during recovery due to increased demand for support services. Housing density and construction activity are also critical, as areas with lower housing density and ongoing upgrades to older structures generally exhibit greater resilience (World Economic Forum - Resilient Infrastructure). These factors, along with emergency response capabilities, medical infrastructure, and economic capacity, collectively determine the baseline readiness for seismic events.
The Endure stage emphasizes the immediate response during and after the earthquake. This includes evaluating the activation of emergency response plans, the effectiveness of search and rescue operations, and the provision of medical care. Municipalities with higher numbers of fire personnel and hospitals per capita are generally better equipped to handle these responsibilities. Population density and logistical constraints also play a significant role in determining the speed and efficiency of emergency operations (FEMA Earthquake Response and Recovery).
The Recover stage focuses on the actions taken post-earthquake to restore normalcy. Rapid damage assessments, restoration of essential services, and removal of debris are critical measures for recovery. Temporary shelters and inspections of damaged infrastructure ensure that displaced populations are housed safely while minimizing further risks. Municipalities with higher purchasing power per capita and robust economic infrastructure can generally execute recovery efforts more effectively (World Bank - Lessons from Global Earthquakes).
The Adapt stage evaluates how communities incorporate lessons learned to improve future resilience. This includes analyzing the effectiveness of response actions and updating building codes and regulations (FEMA Earthquake Mitigation Guide). Enhancing education and training, improving early warning systems, and developing long-term risk reduction strategies are essential components of this phase (California Office of Emergency Services - Earthquake Preparedness). Localized data, such as the resilience scores from different Portuguese regions, informs these adaptive measures by identifying specific areas for improvement (Utah Disaster Resilience Strategies).
Throughout the evaluation phase, the integration of findings across the PERA stages provides a comprehensive understanding of the system's performance. Municipal resilience scores(see Figure 30) highlight variations across regions, such as Murtosa’s higher score (0.548) compared to São João da Madeira (0.469) in Aveiro or Corvo’s leading resilience (0.625) in the Azores versus Praia da Vitória’s lower score (0.351). These findings underline the diverse capacities of municipalities to withstand and recover from seismic activities, guiding targeted interventions and regional development strategies (World Economic Forum - Resilient Infrastructure).
The results of the evaluation are intended to guide future decision-making and planning. Feedback from this phase informs the adaptation of strategies, helping communities evolve in response to the lessons learned. This iterative process strengthens the overall framework, making it a critical component of the RIACT process for seismic resilience.

5.5	Treatment
The treatment strategies for earthquake resilience presented in this analysis are derived from a comprehensive review of various authoritative sources and guidelines. These include the FEMA Earthquake Mitigation Guide, World Economic Forum's Resilient Infrastructure, FEMA Earthquake Response and Recovery, World Bank's Lessons from Global Earthquakes, California Office of Emergency Services' Earthquake Preparedness, and Utah Disaster Resilience Strategies. These resources provided a solid foundation for identifying actions that are effective in addressing seismic risks. The focus was on strategies that balance cost efficiency, risk reduction, and performance enhancement, ensuring that each action is practical and relevant for regions prone to earthquakes. By reviewing these established sources, the strategies aim to create a robust approach to earthquake preparedness and resilience.
The evaluation of each treatment strategy utilizes a scoring system that combines expert opinions and detailed research. Experts in the fields of earthquake preparedness, risk management, and disaster response assessed each strategy based on three key factors: cost efficiency, risk reduction potential, and performance enhancement. These strategies were then assigned scores on a scale from 1 to 10, where 10 represents the highest possible performance. This scoring system provides a structured way to compare the effectiveness of each strategy, helping to identify which interventions are the most viable and impactful. The average score for each strategy serves as an overall indicator of its effectiveness, assisting decision-makers in prioritizing actions based on evidence-based analysis and expert evaluation.
The categorization of strategies follows the RIACT framework, which groups them into four categories: mitigation, transfer, acceptance, and avoidance. These categories are assigned semantically based on the primary and secondary functions of each strategy, taking into account the findings from relevant studies and expert judgments. In some cases, strategies fit into more than one category, reflecting their multi-faceted role in earthquake resilience. For example, seismic hazard mapping serves both as a mitigation and avoidance strategy, as it helps reduce risks by identifying vulnerable areas and also guides the relocation of critical infrastructure away from high-risk zones. By assigning appropriate categories, the strategies align with the RIACT framework, enabling a holistic approach to resilience planning.
Table 5 below provides a detailed analysis of the treatment strategies, presenting their scores across cost efficiency, risk reduction, and performance enhancement, along with their associated categories. This table serves as a valuable tool in the treatment stage of the RIACT process, allowing for a clear, evidence-based comparison of strategies. The categorization and evaluation enable decision-makers to identify which actions are most suitable for addressing specific challenges in earthquake resilience, facilitating informed and effective decision-making to protect communities from seismic risks.

Explanation of Headers:
•	C (Cost Efficiency): Evaluates how cost-effective the strategy is.
•	R (Risk Reduction): Measures the strategy’s effectiveness in mitigating risks.
•	P (Performance Improvement): Assesses the strategy's role in enhancing operational or community response capabilities.
•	Avg (Average Score): The average of the three scores (C, R, and P) to provide an overall performance indicator.
•	Cat (Categories): Represents the treatment strategy classification based on the RIACT framework: Mitigation, Transfer, Acceptance, or Avoidance. 

The strategies for enhancing earthquake resilience offer a range of approaches that tackle different aspects of seismic risk, from reducing physical damage to improving community preparedness. Each strategy was scored based on its cost efficiency, risk reduction potential, and performance improvement. These factors were evaluated by experts and through research on their effectiveness in earthquake-prone regions. The resulting scores reflect the relative importance and feasibility of each strategy in mitigating damage during a seismic event.
Among the top-performing strategies, critical asset fortification and retrofitting infrastructure stand out for their high scores in both risk reduction and performance enhancement. These measures are designed to strengthen key structures and infrastructure, ensuring they can withstand seismic shocks. While costly, their long-term benefits in reducing damage and maintaining essential services during and after an earthquake make them critical components of a comprehensive resilience strategy. Similarly, redundant utility systems provide robust backup solutions to maintain critical services, even during major disruptions, which is essential for community recovery.
On the other hand, strategies such as community training programs and public awareness campaigns are more cost-effective but have a less direct impact on risk reduction. While these measures do not directly reduce seismic risks, they contribute significantly to community preparedness. Early warning systems and seismic hazard mapping serve dual roles in mitigation and avoidance, helping communities prepare for and respond to earthquakes by providing critical information before, during, and after an event. These strategies play an important role in reducing casualties and damage by enabling timely interventions and guiding decisions on resource allocation and evacuation.
Lastly, relocation of critical assets presents a significant risk reduction potential, as it removes essential infrastructure from high-risk zones. However, its implementation is costly and complex. It fits within the avoidance category, as it aims to eliminate risks by physically distancing vital resources from areas most likely to be affected by seismic events. The combination of these diverse strategies—structural, operational, and community-focused—creates a resilient framework that balances high-impact interventions with cost-effective preparedness measures, ensuring that communities are better equipped to handle the challenges posed by earthquakes.
5.6	Supportive elements
After having all the RIACT core elements in place, it is crucial to implement various supportive elements to make the earthquake monitoring and management system more effective. While many of these elements are already incorporated into existing systems, structuring them into the RIACT process helps make them more tangible and meaningful. The examples discussed below, from both global and Portuguese systems, demonstrate how these supportive elements can enhance earthquake preparedness, response, and recovery. They underline the importance of systematic monitoring, communication, and reporting in managing seismic risks.
Monitor and Review is the first supportive tool of the RIACT as explained in the methodology section and here some examples are presented from body of knowledge. In Australia, the National Earthquake Alerts Centre (NEAC) uses high-availability ICT systems to provide reliable, real-time monitoring and alerting for global earthquakes. By receiving seismic data from over 100 Australian locations and 500+ worldwide locations, NEAC can estimate earthquake location, magnitude, and focal mechanism. The centre conducts three levels of review—initial, interim, and final—to ensure the accuracy and timeliness of alerts (Geoscience Australia). Similarly, Portugal’s national seismic network monitors seismic activity across mainland Portugal, the Azores, and Madeira islands. This network relies on hundreds of sensors, which detect ground shaking and water displacement. The University of Évora is expanding this network, which will contribute to an Earthquake Early Warning System (EEWS) (University of Porto).
Monitor and Review processes must be adaptive and responsive to changing conditions. In Portugal, the National Institute for Sea and Atmosphere (IPMA) plays a vital role in earthquake monitoring. It can detect seismic events and notify authorities within eight minutes. These real-time alerts can trigger a swift response from civil protection agencies. The IPMA's network, together with the newly installed stations, allows for continuous evaluation of earthquake risks and the effectiveness of response strategies (Portuguese Institute for Sea and Atmosphere).
Communication and Consulting is the second supportive tools used and the examples are provided. In Australia, NEAC uses multiple communication channels, such as social media and community meetings, to raise awareness of earthquake risks. Messages are tailored to specific audiences based on cultural and linguistic factors to ensure they are understood and acted upon. Similarly, in Portugal, authorities use various platforms, including the National Emergency and Civil Protection Authority (ANEPC) and mobile apps, to disseminate earthquake alerts. In the case of imminent earthquakes, messages can be broadcast via text messages and sirens. This quick dissemination of information allows people to take protective actions (ANEPC).
Effective communication requires ongoing engagement with the public. In Portugal, the Land Based SMS system broadcasts warnings to citizens in affected areas, even to roaming individuals. This ensures that everyone, regardless of their location, receives timely information about seismic events. Furthermore, public awareness campaigns that use visual aids, such as maps and infographics, help improve the understanding of seismic hazards. Clear and concise messaging through these platforms is essential for ensuring public cooperation during earthquake events (Submerse).
Recording and Reporting systems, as the third and last RIACT supportive element, are integral to earthquake management, ensuring that all seismic activity is accurately documented. The Australian system utilizes seismographs that measure vibrations caused by earthquakes. These devices transmit real-time data to central monitoring stations, where it is analyzed. Different types of seismographs are used, including short-period seismographs for local events and long-period seismographs for distant events. In Portugal, similar technologies are used. The INESC TEC institution in Portugal uses distributed acoustic sensors (HDAS) installed on submarine cables to detect seismic events. These sensors can identify both local and long-distance seismic activity, making them essential for earthquake monitoring (INESC TEC).
The Recording and Reporting process also involves advanced tools for monitoring structural integrity during earthquakes. For example, the ROBO®QUAKE monitoring system, used in some regions, provides detailed data on how buildings behave during seismic events. This information is essential for assessing the performance of structures and making necessary improvements to ensure safety. Similarly, Portugal has integrated such technologies into their earthquake management systems, where collected data is analyzed in partnership with international institutions to improve seismic risk assessments. These practices emphasize the importance of accurate data collection and sharing in earthquake preparedness (Mageba Group).
In implementing the best practices from both global and Portuguese examples, cities and organizations should prioritize real-time monitoring systems and communication channels that are easily accessible to the public. It is critical to ensure that the data collected is continuously analyzed and shared with relevant stakeholders, including government agencies, civil protection teams, and the public. By integrating advanced technologies, such as HDAS sensors and mobile notification systems, earthquake management efforts can become more efficient. Additionally, ongoing communication with the public ensures that everyone is informed and prepared to respond during an earthquake event.
From a personal perspective, the integration of these supportive elements into the RIACT process will improve the overall resilience of communities to earthquake risks. Real-time data monitoring, combined with effective communication strategies, can create a more dynamic and responsive earthquake management system. However, to truly enhance resilience, it is crucial to involve local communities in preparedness efforts. Encouraging public participation in earthquake drills and providing easy-to-understand risk information will ensure a more effective response during emergencies.
Earthquake monitoring and management systems benefit from the inclusion of supportive elements such as Monitor and Review, Communication and Consulting, and Recording and Reporting. By integrating these elements into the RIACT process, cities and organizations can improve their preparedness, response, and recovery efforts. The examples from both global and Portuguese systems show how these elements work together to enhance earthquake resilience. Properly implementing these elements will lead to more effective management of seismic risks and help communities better withstand the impact of earthquakes.
5.7	Discussion 
In this discussion, we address the key questions raised regarding the application of the RIACT framework for evaluating and enhancing urban resilience to earthquakes, specifically focusing on the case study of Portuguese municipalities. We will explore the rationale behind the methodological choices, address potential limitations, and discuss the implications of the findings for earthquake preparedness and mitigation strategies.
The selection of municipalities as the primary unit of analysis stems from their role as the fundamental administrative unit responsible for disaster management in Portugal. While acknowledging intra-municipal variability, this approach allows for a standardized assessment across the country, facilitating comparison and resource allocation. Focusing on municipalities provides a practical level for implementing resilience measures and coordinating responses, considering that data collection and management often occur at this level.
Data sources like seismic maps and demographic data, while valuable, have inherent limitations. The study acknowledges these limitations by utilizing a multi-faceted approach, incorporating historical earthquake data, geological information, and socioeconomic indicators to create a more comprehensive picture of risk. The entropy weighting method helps balance the influence of different indicators, minimizing potential bias from any single data source. Further research could explore incorporating more granular data, where available, to refine the analysis.
Data processing and spatial representation using Python and QGIS were validated through rigorous quality control procedures. The code used for data processing is available for review, promoting transparency. The spatial outputs generated were cross-referenced with existing geographical data to ensure accuracy. The entropy weighting method's mathematical foundation provides an objective basis for weighting different indicators, further enhancing the reliability of the results.
The statistical data on earthquake frequency and magnitude in Portugal serves as a crucial input for understanding the overall seismic hazard context. This information, combined with municipality-specific vulnerability data derived from the selected indicators, allows for a localized risk assessment. The RIACT framework facilitates this integration by considering both the likelihood of seismic events and the potential impact on each municipality, resulting in a more nuanced understanding of risk.
The selected vulnerability indicators were chosen based on data availability, relevance to earthquake impacts, and adaptability to the HASC system. These indicators represent key factors influencing a municipality's capacity to withstand and recover from an earthquake, including economic resources, educational attainment, demographic characteristics, housing conditions, emergency response capabilities, and access to healthcare. While other factors might contribute to vulnerability, these indicators provide a practical and measurable starting point for assessment within the constraints of available data.
The PERA stages (Prepare, Endure, Recover, Adapt) are integral to the RIACT framework and are operationalized through the chosen indicators. For instance, Prepare considers factors like municipal revenue and education levels, reflecting preparedness capacity. Endure focuses on indicators like fire personnel and hospitals per capita, measuring immediate response capabilities. Recover utilizes indicators such as purchasing power, reflecting economic recovery potential. Adapt considers all previous stages, emphasizing long-term resilience building based on lessons learned. This integration provides a holistic view of resilience across different phases of an earthquake event.
The RIACT framework acknowledges the potential for cascading effects between infrastructure systems by analyzing vulnerability and resilience at the municipal level. While the current analysis does not explicitly model interdependencies, the selection of indicators reflects the interconnected nature of urban systems. For example, housing density, construction activity, and fire personnel per capita are indirectly linked, as denser housing with older construction may increase the challenges for fire response. Future research could explore incorporating network analysis to explicitly model these interdependencies.
The scoring system for treatment strategies, while relying on expert opinions, strives for objectivity by using clearly defined criteria: cost efficiency, risk reduction, and performance enhancement. Experts were provided with detailed information about each strategy and followed a standardized evaluation process. The average score for each strategy represents a consensus view, mitigating individual biases. Further research could explore incorporating quantitative data on strategy effectiveness to complement expert judgments.
The apparent conflict between cost-effectiveness and high-cost measures like critical asset fortification is addressed through prioritization within the RIACT framework. While acknowledging the importance of high-impact, high-cost measures, the framework emphasizes a balanced approach, considering both short-term and long-term benefits. The scoring system, incorporating cost efficiency as a key criterion, helps decision-makers balance risk reduction potential with budget constraints. Ultimately, the prioritization of strategies depends on the specific context and risk profile of each municipality.
The supportive elements of the RIACT framework (Monitor and Review, Communication and Consulting, Recording and Reporting) are essential for ensuring that the framework is not a static document but a dynamic process. The case study provides examples of how these elements are operationalized in practice, such as real-time monitoring systems and public awareness campaigns. By emphasizing continuous monitoring, communication, and feedback loops, the RIACT framework promotes adaptive management, allowing for adjustments based on evolving conditions and lessons learned. This iterative approach is crucial for enhancing urban resilience in the long term.
This case study contributes to the field of urban resilience by providing a structured methodology for assessing and enhancing earthquake preparedness at the municipal level. The RIACT framework, coupled with the PERA stages and supportive elements, offers a practical approach for integrating diverse data sources and translating them into actionable strategies. The use of G-URES and the entropy weighting method provides a systematic way to combine and analyze complex information, facilitating evidence-based decision-making.
However, the study acknowledges limitations related to data availability and the complexity of modeling interdependencies between infrastructure systems. The reliance on municipal-level data, while practical, may mask intra-municipal variations in vulnerability and resilience. Future research could explore incorporating more granular data and advanced modeling techniques to address these limitations.
Despite these limitations, the study offers valuable insights into the varying levels of earthquake risk and resilience across Portuguese municipalities. The findings highlight the importance of localized strategies and the need for continuous monitoring, evaluation, and adaptation to enhance earthquake preparedness and mitigation efforts. The RIACT framework provides a valuable tool for guiding these efforts, promoting a more proactive and integrated approach to urban resilience.
5.8	Final remarks 
In these final remarks, we will address broader implications of the case study findings, focusing on policy recommendations, the integration of social and cultural factors, and the long-term implementation of the RIACT framework as a continuous improvement process for enhancing urban resilience to earthquakes.
National-level policies can play a key role in supporting local resilience efforts by providing financial incentives, technical expertise, and standardized guidelines for risk assessment and mitigation. Resource allocation mechanisms should prioritize municipalities with higher vulnerability and lower resilience scores, ensuring equitable distribution of support. Establishing national platforms for sharing best practices and fostering collaboration among municipalities can further enhance the effectiveness of local initiatives.
Integrating social and cultural factors into the RIACT framework requires considering community-specific vulnerabilities and leveraging local knowledge. Engaging community members in the assessment and planning processes can foster a sense of ownership and increase the relevance of resilience strategies. Building trust between communities and institutions is essential for effective communication and cooperation during emergencies. Incorporating cultural values and practices into preparedness and response plans can further enhance their effectiveness.
Implementing the RIACT framework as a continuous improvement process involves regular monitoring and evaluation of resilience levels, updating data sources, and adapting strategies based on lessons learned. Establishing feedback mechanisms and incorporating new technologies can improve the accuracy and timeliness of risk assessments. Promoting ongoing training and capacity building within municipalities ensures that resilience strategies remain aligned with evolving earthquake risks and urban development patterns.

This case study offers a valuable contribution to the field of urban resilience by demonstrating the application of the RIACT framework for assessing and enhancing earthquake preparedness. While acknowledging limitations related to data granularity and the complexity of modeling interdependencies, the study provides a practical methodology for integrating diverse data sources and translating them into actionable strategies. The findings underscore the importance of localized approaches, continuous monitoring, and community engagement in building resilient cities capable of withstanding and recovering from seismic events.
